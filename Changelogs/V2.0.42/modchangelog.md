	Cyclic (Cyclic-1.12.2-1.19.21.jar --> Cyclic-1.12.2-1.20.2.jar):
		Cyclic-1.12.2-1.20.2.jar:
			Put in some checks in case a player is logging out and in with a bounce potion effects.
			Item Sorter: Normal mode now matches NBT (enchantments etc); and new Ore Dictionary mode added

		Cyclic-1.12.2-1.20.1.jar:
			Fixed startup crash that happens only IF FastWorkbench not installed
			See previous changelog [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cyclic/files/2929505](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cyclic/files/2929505)

		Cyclic-1.12.2-1.20.0.jar:
			Updated 'block placement' logic through the entire mod, so things like building scepters and machines place blocks and keep their NBT data (like shulker boxes) as well as relative player directions, also improved compatibility with any blocks having special onItemUse logic/metadata.
			Workbench now quickly and cleanly syncs between multiple players using it at the same time.
			Excavate no longer allows tools to go into negative durability (correctly uses native attemptDamageItem to handle unbreaking enchant, tool damage, and tool breaking).
			GPS Marker now stores specific location of the hit within the block, the players facing direction, and the block-face clicked on (shows on tooltip while holding sneak)
			Structure Builder GUI changed, removed offset sliders and replaced with GPS slot; removed rotations value.
			Structure builder now optionally uses the GPS markers, so you can target an offset location and set the orientation of rotating blocks such as stairs.
			Structure builder Diagonal setting now uses size to build across just like a roof.
			Structure builder has a new Horizontal Cylander building mode.
			Renamed Cyclic building scepter to Ranged Building Scepter; it now renders an outline of the distant block that it will place.
			GPS Marker now renders an outline of the selected block.
			The three anvils now can be rotated like regular anvils.
			Allow cables to be harvested and dropped as items when broken by hand.
			Fluid Drain now has a Preview Render button to show the currently targeted block.
			Rebuilt and fixed saturation potion.
			Vision Helmet no longer grants glowing effect.
			Interdiction Pulsar now works on hostile mobs riding non-hostile living mobs by moving their mounts (such as zombie chicken riders or mobs on horses).
			Fixed pattern replicator render outline button.
			Pattern replicator redesigned and now use GPS Markers to select areas to copy and paste.
			Pattern replicator now builds from the bottom up so that unsupported blocks such as redstone dust or carpet builds more reliably.
			Fixed issue in Exp pylon -500 button.
			Each quadrant of Ender Library can store 999999 enchantments, up from 64.
			Ender Library now saves its data when picked up and placed down as an item, for safe transport like a shulker box.
			Fixed Model Variant Exceptions showing in log file.
			Fixed water candle sometimes spawning mobs in the ground or creating other duplicate blocks.
			All dynamyte now uses ExplosionEvent.Start event to allow other mods to hook and cancel explosions if needed.
			Piston Scepter: removed rotate mode (wooden wrench does exactly this); Piston scepter now pushes a whole line of blocks not just one, matching real piston behavior; also it checks canPlayerMove for permission hooks.
			Ender Library now checks for enchanted books of stack size != 1 for mod compatibility.
			Improve Storage Bag button tooltips for useability.
			Storage Bag deposit updated to use capabilities (more compatible with more modded inventories for example AA Crates).
			Added crystallized_amber and crystallized_obsidian to default BlacklistInput config for the uncrafter (not affecting existing modpacks but reccomended to add these values).
			Updated how Forester looks for ore dictionary logWood blocks when logs have metadata (fixes Biomes o Plenty trees in forester).
			Forester now skips air blocks faster.
			Password Trigger now works if player is in a different dimension than the block (if blocks chunk is loaded by something).
			Added configs to tweak the x/y offsets of the inventory buttons.
			Added a few more refinedstorage items to SackHoldingBlacklist config (some RS blocks dont use compatible tile entity NBT storage).

	Trinkets and Baubles (Trinkets and Baubles 0.29.2 --> Trinkets and Baubles 0.30):
		Trinkets and Baubles 0.30:
			This Version has Updated Compatibility with Enhanced Visuals, To use it, you must use Enhanced Visuals 1.3.6 or Later, using an Earlier Version will cause a Crash.
			As you may or may not know, Trinkets and Baubles is now Standalone from the mod "Baubles" by Azanor, but Functionality is limited, So I Do Suggest using Baubles still.
			Added Lang Key's to Virtually everything, Which should allow for much easier translation into other languages in the future.

			 * Added Tons of Tooltips. 
			 * Replaced JEI Description interface with Tooltips on the Items themselves. 
			 * Fixed a Crash when equipping an item into the Trinket Gui when using a Number key. 
			 * Fixed a bunch of minor bugs people probably never noticed. 
			 * Optimized the polarized stone code. 
			 * Rewrote the player Capability and Item Capability. 
			 * Due to the Capability Rewrite I use less packets, which should hopefully fix some issues when changing dimension, and should also stop the error/crash reports Vanilla Fix spits out. 
			 * I Made it possible to Wear more then one Enchanted Race ring at a time, but doing so nullifies both and gives no benefit. 
			 * Added the ability to change Attribute Settings for every Trinket. 
			 * New Trinket "Ring of the Titans", It turns the player 3x the normal size, by default it makes the player slower, but increases damage and greatly increases Health, all options are configurable, If in water, you sink faster (Because you're supposed to be 'Heavy'), if on land and you step on crops, it tramples them into dirt. both options configurable. 
			 * Added a Config option to disable the new EntityRenderer I use for the Fairy, Dwarf, Titan Ring. 
			 * Added a Config Option to Disable fog in the new EntityRenderer previously talked about. 
			 * Transformation potions now work on Entities other then the player, Disabled by Default in the config.  Unfortunately I probably will not be able to have the 2nd Trinket I Talked about Previously in the 0.30 Release, I will still try, but the Translation work took much longer then I thought it would.
			Thanks to Z-Tunic who frequents the Mod page and github for helping Making new Textures for all the Rings.
			Also thanks to NyanMinecrafter, Who has been helping maintain the new Github Wiki page, and helping with grammer and spelling.
			and Finally, thanks to 502y, who has been helping translate the mod into Chinese.

		Trinkets and Baubles 0.30-Pre-Release-1.5:
			 * Added a Config option to disable the new EntityRenderer I use for the Fairy, Dwarf, Titan Ring. 
			 * Added a Config Option to Disable fog in the new EntityRenderer previously talked about. This is a Beta, Although it's very complete, there is a lot of work that still needs to be done, mainly cosmetic but still.
			Please backup any important worlds before using this Beta.
			Due to a Request by Shivaxi (RLCraft) I have uploaded this Version Without Updated Enhanced Visuals Compatibility (See Seperate Upload for updated Compatibility).
