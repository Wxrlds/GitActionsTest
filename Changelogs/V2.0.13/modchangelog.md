		tmel-1.12.2-1.4.0.0.jar:
			 * Added method to get a consistent name for generators.
			 * Added option to disable the default recipe(s) for any item added by Extra Utilities. The game has to be restarted to change these values.
			 * Added RecipeDisabler class that extends ValueModifier.
			 * Added refresh() to TooManyEfficiencyLosses instead of calling individual methods in ConfigTMEL when options are changed.
			 * Added requiredMods property to mcmod.info.
			 * Added time elapsed to logged messages that signal the end of an operation.
			 * Added useDependencyInformation to mcmod.info. Not having Extra Utilities 2 installed shows an error message rather than crashing.
			 * Added useMetadata annotation to TooManyEfficiencyLosses.
			 * Changed all Extra Utilities and Minecraft modifying classes to instances that extend ValueModifier.
			 * Created a generic ValueModifier class which everything that modifies Extra Utilities and Minecraft fields extends.
			 * Created a ValueModifier annotation to automatically discover children classes and register them for load operations.
			 * Loading stages changed to call a generic method that records the time spent for the operation.
			 * Logger replaced with one specifically for mods. It looks nicer, is less obtrusive, works on servers, and runs faster (probably).
			 * Machines now refreshed when toggling GP.
			 * MCP Mappings updated to snapshot_20180814.
			 * Minecraft Forge updated to 14.23.5.2838.
			 * Moved initialization for Maps in the config to a method called during post-initialization. This is necessary to collect Extra Utilities recipes. It also lets the mod use the display names for the different generators. It looks a lot nicer. You'll need to delete the current config if you want to not have useless values clogging it up.
			 * Moved log messages during initialization to their specific classes.
			 * Renamed a bunch of classes in an attempt to better describe their usage.
		tmel-1.12.2-1.4.0.0-beta3.jar:
			From 1.12.2-1.4.0.0-beta2:

			 * Added a try-catch to the setValues() method in GPRateMultipliers for NullPointerExceptions. This should be a temporary fix for two reported crashes at that location ([#4](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/too-many-efficiency-losses/issues/4)).
		tmel-1.12.2-1.4.0.0-beta2.jar:
			Beta Version! Not tested in a compiled environment!

			It is recommended that you delete the current configuration file for the mod.

			From 1.12.2-1.4.0.0-beta1:

			 * Added method to ValueModifier to prevent setValues() from being called at a specific time, like during refresh().
			 * Added option to disable the default recipe(s) for any item added by Extra Utilities. The game has to be restarted to change these values.
			 * Added RecipeDisabler class that extends ValueModifier.
			 * Changed time elapsed to display fractions of a millisecond, for those instances that this mod is too darn fast.
			 * Moved forEachGeneratorType() to its own class with a small method to get the display name for the generators.
			 * Moved initialization for Maps in the config to a method called during post-initialization. This is necessary to collect Extra Utilities recipes. It also lets the mod use the display names for the different generators. It looks a lot nicer. You'll need to delete the current config if you want to not have useless values clogging it up.
			 * Split postInit() for ValueModifier into one method that runs at the start of post-initialization and one that runs at the end.
		tmel-1.12.2-1.4.0.0-beta1.jar:
			Beta Version! Not tested in a compiled environment!
